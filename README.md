# Unix Command-Line Utilities in Julia

This repository is dedicated to recreating various Unix command-line utilities in the Julia programming language. The goal of this project is to combine the efficiency and ease of use of Julia with the functionality of traditional Unix utilities. This initiative not only serves as a practical toolkit for those interested in using these tools within a Julia environment but also as an educational resource for those looking to improve their Julia programming skills.

## Introduction

Unix utilities are fundamental tools in software development, system administration, and data processing. Reimplementing these tools in Julia provides an opportunity to explore the capabilities of Julia for system-level programming and script-based automation. This project focuses on creating native Julia implementations that are both performant and idiomatic.

## List of Utilities

Below is the list of Unix utilities that are planned for implementation in this repository. The status of each utility is also provided.

- `ls` - List directory contents. [In Progress]
- `grep` - File pattern searcher. [Planned]
- `cat` - Concatenate and display files. [Planned]
- `echo` - Display a line of text. [Planned]
- `find` - Search for files in a directory hierarchy. [Planned]
- `awk` - Pattern scanning and processing language. [Planned]

More utilities will be added to this list as the project progresses.

## Installation

Currently, the utilities need to be cloned from the repository and run locally. Future updates may include packaging and distribution through Julia's package manager.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/unix-tools-julia.git
cd unix-tools-julia
